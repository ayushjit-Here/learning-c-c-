i have added this repo n my vs code 
i have used "clone https://github.com/ayushjit-Here/learning-c-c-.git"

type ls -force to see hidded flies

use git status to know if tgere is something neede to be commit and add or not

after mofifying(creating or editing a new file) something it will show 4 status:
    untracked (U): new file the git doesnt track
    modeifed (M):  changed
    staged (A): file is stored ready to commit
    unmodified: laude samajh ja

after knowing the poper status u can add then commit
    git add <file name> / git add . (will add all)
    git commit -m "add some message" ( use '#' to keep it clear)

after commiting use push to add t to your remote repo:
    git push origin main
